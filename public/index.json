[{"content":"I am a MSCA PhD student at Laura Elo\u0026rsquo;s lab at the Medical Bioinformatics Centre – Turku Bioscience, under the supervision of Prof. Laura Elo and Dr. Sini Juntilla.\nMy doctoral research lies at the intersection of bioinformatics and immunology, with a focus on optimizing and applying statistical methods for the integration and marker identification of single-cell data. My work is particularly motivated by its application to understanding autoimmune side effects in cancer patients undergoing checkpoint immunotherapy, with the goal of uncovering the mechanisms that trigger these immune responses.\nWith an academic background in cell and molecular biology, I began my research career with a master’s project at the EcoBioTec lab in CiiMAR – University of Porto, under the supervision of Prof. Catarina Magalhães, Dr. Pedro Duarte, and Prof. Luís Torgo, where I applied bioinformatics to study the marine Arctic microbiome beneath drifting sea ice. I went on to gain further professional experience as a project researcher at EcoBioTec and later as a bioinformatician at the core facility of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, working under the coordination of Dr. Jingtao Lilue until mid-2021.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://antonioggsousa.github.io/about/","section":"About","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"\nI am a MSCA PhD student at Laura Elo\u0026rsquo;s lab at the Medical Bioinformatics Centre – Turku Bioscience, under the supervision of Prof. Laura Elo and Dr. Sini Juntilla.\nIn general, I am interested in applying bioinformatics to address questions in systems biology, particularly through single-cell data analyses.\nOccasionally, I answer questions related to programming (R/Bash/Python), metabarcoding, metagenomics, and transcriptomics on Biostars.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://antonioggsousa.github.io/","section":"António GG Sousa's website","summary":"","title":"António GG Sousa's website"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://antonioggsousa.github.io/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Download CV Summary I am a MSCA PhD student at Laura Elo\u0026rsquo;s lab at the Medical Bioinformatics Centre – Turku Bioscience, under the supervision of Prof. Laura Elo and Dr. Sini Juntilla.
