I am a [MSCA PhD student](https://www.enlight-ten.eu) at [Laura Elo's lab](https://bioscience.fi/research/computational-biomedicine) at the <a href="https://elolab.utu.fi" target="_blank">Medical Bioinformatics Centre</a> – <a href="https://bioscience.fi" target="_blank">Turku Bioscience</a>, under the supervision of [Prof. Laura Elo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w9qgsIcAAAAJ) and [Dr. Sini Juntilla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KCc6UEAAAAAJ).

My doctoral research lies at the intersection of bioinformatics and immunology, with a focus on optimizing and applying statistical methods for the integration and marker identification of single-cell data. My work is particularly motivated by its application to understanding autoimmune side effects in cancer patients undergoing checkpoint immunotherapy, with the goal of uncovering the mechanisms that trigger these immune responses.

With an academic background in cell and molecular biology, I began my research career with a master’s project at the EcoBioTec lab in [CiiMAR – University of Porto](https://www.ciimar.up.pt), under the supervision of [Prof. Catarina Magalhães](https://www.ciimar.up.pt/teams/microbiome-ecology-and-biogeochemistry), [Dr. Pedro Duarte](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7461-605X), and [Prof. Luís Torgo](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~ltorgo), where I applied bioinformatics to study [the marine Arctic microbiome beneath drifting sea ice](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/110665). I went on to gain further professional experience as a project researcher at EcoBioTec and later as a bioinformatician at the core facility of the [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gimm.pt), working under the coordination of [Dr. Jingtao Lilue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fENcmP8AAAAJ) until mid-2021.
