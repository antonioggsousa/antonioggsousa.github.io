My PhD research lies at the intersection of bioinformatics and immunology, with a focus on optimizing and applying statistical methods for the integration and marker identification of single-cell data. My work is particularly motivated by its application to understanding autoimmune side effects in cancer patients undergoing checkpoint immunotherapy, with the goal of uncovering the mechanisms that trigger these immune responses.
